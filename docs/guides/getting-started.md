# Get Started with Companyname Cloud API

To use the Companyname Cloud, you can use either the web-based [Data Center Designer (DCD)](https://dcd.companyname.com/ "Open Companyname Data Center Designer") or the Companyname Cloud API. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a programmatic interface that lets you interact with services to manage and control resources. This article uses a simple example to explain how to execute your first API request.

## Using API Requests
1. [Authenticate](https://docs.companyname.com/cloud/reference/get-started?q=authent#authorization "Read how to authenticate") with the companyname API.
2. Use a HTTP GET command to retrieve a list of all users stored in the directory /v1/users: `curl GET https://example.com/v1/users `
